### Breaking Changes

None — v1.0.16 is the baseline release establishing current feature set.

### Known Issues

- Installers are **unsigned** — Expected security warnings on installation (see [INSTALLATION_SECURITY_WARNINGS.md](INSTALLATION_SECURITY_WARNINGS.md))
- Code signing certificates not yet provisioned
- Notification system not implemented
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks is basic

### Installation

See [INSTALLATION_SECURITY_WARNINGS.md](INSTALLATION_SECURITY_WARNINGS.md) for OS-specific security warning resolution.

> ⚠️ **Security Notice**
> Installers and packages are currently **unsigned**. This is expected. VibeMD is safe, free of malware, and does not collect user data. See installation guide for bypass instructions.
