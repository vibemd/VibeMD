# VibeMD installation - Resolving security warnings

**Application:** VibeMD **Version:** 1.0.13 **Release Date:** 2025-10-28 **License:** MIT

## Overview

VibeMD is currently deployed unsigned. This means that operating systems like Windows and macOS cannot verify the validity of the developer of the application and so will prompt the user with security warnings and recommend that app is not installed. VibeMD is safe to use and free of malware and spyware and does not collect or transmit information from/about the user or device on which it is installed.

To overcome the security warnings, follow these instructions:
