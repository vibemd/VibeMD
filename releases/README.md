# VibeMD Release Artifacts

This directory holds release-ready binaries collected from local builds to simplify handoff for publishing.

## macOS

- `macos/arm64`: Apple Silicon (M1/M2) DMG and ZIP builds.
- `macos/x64`: Intel macOS DMG and ZIP builds.

Artifacts mirror what GitHub Actions would upload. Replace these files with newer builds as part of the release process.
